# MouseMobilâ„¢
While human transportation systems have soared in progress over the past century, mouse transportation systems have stagnated. We're making a small vehicle (think shoebox-sized) that attracts mice inside and uses a camera to allow a mouse to control the velocity of the vehicle, in the hopes of creating a more inclusive world for our small and furry friends.
